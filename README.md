# hardback-word-finder
Shiny App code used to obtain words lists for the card game Hardback, available to play for free at https://boardgamearena.com/. The dictionay was pulled from 12dicts (see http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/) using the 2of12inf.txt file (around 82,000 words). The code can quickly be modified to use an alternate dictionary. 

You can find a live version of the shiny app at https://shiny.byui.edu/connect/#/apps/110fa8e7-3ac0-4b5b-a8fc-5bfdca760a1f/access.
